First GIT 

git init - to initialize git
git status - what modifications have been done, which files have been deleted,which files have been changed. you can see all of it through git status command

In Git we first track the file and then add 

Git commit -m "commit message"
-m stands for message for commit 

git add . - to add all the files in staging environment

git checkout (git log commit - number) - to go to that branch 
git checkout master - to go back to the master branch and to see all the branches

git merge (branch name)
git branch (branch name)
git checkout (branch name) - to go into that branch 
git checkout -b krish/mutiply - to switched to a new branch 

touch .gitignore - use to not track the file in git
